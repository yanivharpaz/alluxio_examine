# Terraform Configuration for Azure Infrastructure

This project contains Terraform configurations to set up various resources on Microsoft Azure. 

## File Structure

- `compute.tf`: Contains the configurations for Linux and Windows Virtual Machines (VMs).
- `hadoop.tf`: Contains the configuration for creating an Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster.
- `spark.tf`: Contains the configuration for creating an Azure HDInsight Spark cluster.
- `network.tf`: Contains the configuration for setting up Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and subnets.
- `nic.tf`: Contains the configuration for setting up Azure Network Interfaces for the VMs.
- `main.tf`: The entry point for the Terraform configuration. This is where the provider is configured.
- `provider.tf`: Contains the configuration for the Azure provider.
- `resource_groups.tf`: Contains the configuration for creating an Azure Resource Group.
- `variables.tf`: Contains the declaration for input variables used in the configuration.
- `terraform.tfvars`: A template file for defining the actual values for your variables. Rename to `terraform.tfvars` and fill in your own values for your setup.
- `terraform.tfstate`: This is a system-generated file that keeps track of the resources that Terraform is managing.
- `terraform.tfstate.backup`: A backup of the previous state file.
- `myplan01.tfplan`: This is a saved plan file which Terraform uses to apply changes in your infrastructure.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Copy the `terraform.tfvars.template` file to `terraform.tfvars`.

3. Open the `terraform.tfvars` file and replace the placeholders with your own values.

4. Initialize Terraform in the directory. This will download the necessary provider plugins.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. Plan the deployment. This will show you what changes will be made without actually making any changes.

   ```
   bash  
   terraform plan -out=myplan01.tfplan  
   ```  

6. If the plan looks good, apply the changes. This will create the resources in Azure as per the configuration files.

   ```bash
   terraform apply "myplan01.tfplan"
   ```

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
- [Azure](https://portal.azure.com) subscription

Please ensure to follow best practices for managing secrets in the Terraform files. Avoid hardcoding any sensitive data in the configuration files.
